# Tutorials

This section is the curated, narrative side of the documentation.

## Planned tutorial tracks

1. Geometry and meshing basics
2. Static mechanical analysis
3. Nonlinear constitutive models
4. Cohesive/contact modeling
5. Post-processing and plotting

## Draft status

The previous long-form tutorial content exists in:

- `docs/src/tutorial/tutorial.md`

That page is currently legacy content and needs API refresh before being re-enabled in navigation.

## How this section will evolve

1. Keep tutorials problem-oriented and minimal.
2. Reference real scripts in `examples/` to reduce drift.
3. Add smaller executable blocks only when they are CI-stable.
